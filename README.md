# Crop-Recommendation-System
An IoT-based system to recommend suitable crops using real-time soil and weather data processed with machine learning algorithm 
Recommended accurate crop types with 85% precision using real-time soil and weather data, by deploying ML algorithms on sensor inputs (moisture, temperature, humidity) collected via Arduino.
Improved agricultural decision-making efficiency by 40%, by implementing automated data processing and visualization in Python

## Dataset
The Crop Management System dataset includes the following features:

### Crop Prediction Dataset
- State_Name
- District_Name
- Season
- Crop

### Crop Recommendation Dataset
- N
- P
- K
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH
- Rainfall
- Label

## How to Use
- Crop Prediction: Input `State_Name`, `District_Name`, and `Season` to get the predicted crop for that location.
- Crop Recommendation: Input `N`, `P`, `K`, `Temperature`, `Humidity`, `pH`, and `Rainfall` for that location to get recommended crops for that location.
- Fertilizer Recommendation: Input `Temperature`, `Humidity`, `Soil Moisture`, `Soil Type`, `Crop Type`, `Nitrogen`, `Phosphorous`, and `Potassium` to get recommended fertilizer for that crop and location.
- Rainfall Prediction: Input `Subdivision` and `Year` to get rainfall prediction for that year.
- Yield Prediction: Input `State_Name`, `District_Name`, `Crop_Year`, `Season`, `Crop`, `Area`, `Production` to get predicted yields for that crop and location.
