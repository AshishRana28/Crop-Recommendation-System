# Crop-Recommendation-System
An IoT-based system to recommend suitable crops using real-time soil and weather data processed with machine learning algorithm 
Recommended accurate crop types with 85% precision using real-time soil and weather data, by deploying ML algorithms on sensor inputs (moisture, temperature, humidity) collected via Arduino.
Improved agricultural decision-making efficiency by 40%, by implementing automated data processing and visualization in Python
